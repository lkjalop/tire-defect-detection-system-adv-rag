- Are the async implementations properly structured?
- How does this compare to production RAG systems you've seen?

### **2. Code Quality Analysis**
Please review these core files:
- `main.py` - CLI orchestrator and system integration
- `agents/manufacturing_reasoner.py` - Domain-specific AI reasoner  
- `tools/agentic_rag_engine.py` - Multi-step reasoning system
- `testing/cv_testing.py` - Computer vision performance testing

**Focus areas**:
- Code organization and maintainability
- Error handling and edge cases
- Performance considerations
- Python best practices

### **3. AI/ML Implementation Review**
**Question**: Does this demonstrate **senior-level AI engineering** understanding or **junior-level** implementation?

Evaluate:
- **RAG Sophistication**: Beyond basic similarity search?
- **Multi-Agent Design**: Proper autonomous agent architecture?
- **Performance Optimization**: Real-world inference speeds (657+ FPS)?
- **Domain Integration**: Manufacturing knowledge properly integrated?

### **4. Production Readiness Gap Analysis**
The developer honestly assessed **12.5% production readiness**. Please evaluate:
- Is this assessment accurate?
- What are the most critical missing components?
- How much effort would production deployment require?
- What would you prioritize first?

## üîç **SPECIFIC TECHNICAL QUESTIONS**

### **Performance Claims Verification**
```python
# From cv_testing.py - Are these metrics realistic?
performance_metrics = {
    "average_inference_time": 0.0015s,
    "fps": 657.5,
    "sensitivity": 0.92,
    "specificity": 0.89
}
```
**Question**: Are these performance numbers achievable/realistic for tire defect detection?

### **RAG Architecture Assessment**
```python
# From agentic_rag_engine.py - Is this a proper multi-agent implementation?
reasoning_steps = [
    {"step": "query_analysis", "confidence": 0.85},
    {"step": "knowledge_retrieval", "confidence": 0.90}, 
    {"step": "synthesis", "confidence": 0.87}
]
```
**Question**: Does this represent genuine autonomous reasoning or just sequential processing?

### **Manufacturing Domain Integration**
```python
# From manufacturing_reasoner.py - Is this manufacturing knowledge realistic?
manufacturing_knowledge = {
    "defects": {
        "cracks": {
            "causes": ["temperature_variation", "pressure_inconsistency", "material_quality"],
            "solutions": ["optimize_curing_temperature", "check_material_quality", "calibrate_equipment"]
        }
    }
}
```
**Question**: Is this domain knowledge accurate for tire manufacturing?

## üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY ASSESSMENT REQUEST**

### **OWASP Top 10 API Vulnerabilities Analysis**
The developer mentioned missing OWASP implementation. Please assess:

1. **A01 - Broken Access Control**: Currently no authentication
2. **A02 - Cryptographic Failures**: No encryption implemented  
3. **A03 - Injection**: Basic input validation only
4. **A04 - Insecure Design**: No security-by-design principles
5. **A05 - Security Misconfiguration**: No security configuration
6. **A06 - Vulnerable Components**: No dependency scanning
7. **A07 - Authentication Failures**: No authentication system
8. **A08 - Software Integrity Failures**: No integrity verification
9. **A09 - Logging Failures**: Basic logging only
10. **A10 - SSRF**: No SSRF protection

**Questions**:
- Which vulnerabilities pose the highest risk for this system?
- What would be the minimum security implementation for production?
- How critical are these gaps for an AI system handling manufacturing data?
