Agentic RAG Analysis for: "{query}"

Retrieved Knowledge:
{' '.join(relevant_knowledge[:200])}

Multi-Step Reasoning:
1. Query analysis completed
2. Knowledge retrieval from manufacturing domain
3. Multi-agent synthesis and validation

Conclusion: This demonstrates the agentic RAG approach with autonomous reasoning agents working together to provide comprehensive manufacturing intelligence.
