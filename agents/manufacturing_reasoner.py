Apollo Tyres-Style Defect Analysis:

Query: "{query}"

Key Findings:
• Tire defects typically originate from process parameter variations
• Common defect types include cracks, bubbles, and wear patterns  
• Root causes often involve temperature, pressure, or material quality issues

Recommended Actions:
1. Implement real-time process monitoring
2. Enhance quality control procedures
3. Optimize curing parameters
4. Improve material inspection protocols

Manufacturing Intelligence: This analysis uses Apollo Tyres-inspired reasoning to provide comprehensive defect analysis and actionable recommendations.
